			<p style="font-size: 20px;">Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language. ... Coding conventions are only applicable to the human maintainers and peer reviewers of a software project.As a result, coding has become a core skill that bolsters a candidateâ€™s chances of commanding a high salary. Burning Glass researchers found that jobs that require coding skills pay up to $22,000 per year more, on average. "For students looking to increase their potential income, few other skills open the door to as many well-paying careers," they write in the report. Nearly half (49%) of all jobs that pay more than $58,000 require some coding skills, according to their analysis.</p>
